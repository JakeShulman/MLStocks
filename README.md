# MLStocks

This project is my current focus; it is a three-layered algorithm:

The first layer is a myriad of uniquely configured machine learning algorithms, implemented with Scikit-Learn.

The second is a method of nesting the first layer for further analysis.

The third is a custom built, object oriented, genetic learning algorithm that evolves indiduals to act on the analyses and predict daily stock price change.

For propietary reasons, my code is not public on my GitHub. If you have any further questions please feel free to email me at:
